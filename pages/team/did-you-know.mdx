## Team Nav is a Hackathon Project

Team Nav started as an Artsy hackathon project, and has evolved every year through hackathons and the occasional amount of some developer's free time. If you want to help improve it, there's a #team-nav-2 slack channel.

## Team Heirarchies

If you go to a team, in the top right you can see an option to show the reporting strucutre for a team.

## Who reports to whom

On the flip side, if you go to any profile you can see who reports to someone by clicking 'Show Reporting Structure' in the sidebar

## Floor Plans

When working in a big location like our company HQ, it's useful to have a link to all of the floor plans as well as who is sitting where.

## Audio Pronunciations

Find out how to pronounce someone's name from themselves. We have recorded voice clips of people at Artsy which you can find on people's profile pages.

## Slack Profiles

Team Nav gets a lot of its data from Artsy's slack. So if you fill in your slack profile then that data will show up in Team Nav. For example your Twitter or Instagram handle will show up.

## Someone is online?

You can see a green dot on someone's profile if they're online.

## Team Timezones

We get everyone's timezones from Slack, which is pretty unreliable, but it's better than nothing. On any team you can see a link in the top right for their timezones.

## Who is new

Wondering how long someone has been at the company? Check out the who is new page in the links to the side.

## Show me more

Some users like developers or Artsy editorial have extra information in their profiles too.
